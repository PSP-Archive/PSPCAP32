  on startup and 67 fps at 266Mhz

  inside the emulator, and when possible, they can be run automatically.
- Add eboot's music
- A thumbnail image is now displayed in the file requester 
  while selecting any file with the same name of a previously

  choose the first letter of the game you search !
- In the emulator menu you can go directly to keyboard and settings
  menu using the L-Trigger key.

- Auto-fire mode, press RTrigger+X to switch it on/off
  (useful for games such as defend or die !)

  settings menu to navigate between Normal, LTrigger 
  and  RTrigger compose mapping.

  but it's a lot smoother !
  Old "soft" render modes are still available, because there are
